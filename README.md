# delta-EB32
To make this project we have used OpenCV library of python which is basically used to resolve computer vision problems. First, we imported the cv2 module to access all the functions of OpenCV. We used haarcascade pre-trained data to detect the cars as well as pedestrians. To do some changes in an image or frame of a video first we have to convert BGR scale to Grey scale using cvtcolor function. Then we used a while loop and imread function to read the video imported frame by frame. Then we used the multiscale function to get the rectangular coordinates of cars and pedestrians. Then we used rectangle function to draw rectangle around cars and pedestrians. To show the video frame by frame we used imshow function. Then we used waitkey to allow the user when he wants to stop the program. Similarly we have approached for face detection as well.
For GUI we use Tkinter as a library, in which we use some basic information such as label, button, frames, geometry, etc. We add some label for heading purpose and radio buttons and buttons to choose the given field. We also make a input box from where we get user input file path and take the input and use it in our openCV program. We also define some functions to operate those button s which we have used. After taking inputs from user we display the corresponding output.
